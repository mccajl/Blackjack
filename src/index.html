    <h1>Rules:</h1>
    <p>
        Place your bet by clicking the chips before choosing either play game or new round. <br><br>
        The cards are dealt, both face up to the player, and with one card face down to the dealer. <br><br>
        The goal of BlackJack is to have a higher card "value" than the dealer, without going over 21. <br><br>
        Your total value is the sum of the value of the cards in your hand. <br><br>
        All face cards are worth 10, while Ace has a value of either 11 or 1 depending on what is optimal. <br><br>
        You can choose "hit" to draw another card, or "stand" to end your turn. <br><br>
        The game ends when the player either chooses "stand", the player busts, or the player accumulates 5 cards without exceeding 21. <br><br>
        If the player stands, the dealer draws until they reach 17 and a value above the player. Should the dealer bust, the player wins.<br><br>
        If the player busts (exceeds 21), they lose. <br><br>
        If the player accumulates 5 cards in their hand, they win. <br><br>
